"""
Load GH teams, specified repos, and user/team permissions on those repos.

Dumps JSON to migrate/export-$ORGANIZATION.json. Logs progess to stderr.

Usage:
    python -m migrate.github_to_json.py ORGANIZATION
Or just:
    make migrat-github-to-json

Requirement installation:
    make migrate-requirements  # in a virtualenv, from repo root

Other requirements:
    * Python >=3.8
    * Expects a personal GH access token in the environment as GITHUB_TOKEN.
      (The token needs owner-level read access to ORGANIZATION.)
    * Expects list of repo names for transfer at
      `migrate/repos-ORGANIZATION.txt`.

Linting:
    make migrate-requirements-dev  # in a virtualenv, from repo root
    make migrate-lint
